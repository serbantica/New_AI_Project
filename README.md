# AI_New_Project

This repository is a **dynamic project scaffolding tool**, not just a static template. It's designed to guide you through the entire lifecycle of a modern AI project, from initial idea to production deployment.

## üó∫Ô∏è The Project Lifecycle: From Template to Production

This template is designed to guide you through the entire lifecycle of an AI project. Here‚Äôs the journey you'll take:

### **Phase 1: Project Initialization & Chartering**
1.  **Fork & Bootstrap:** You start by forking this repo and running the `./project_bootstrap.sh` script. This sets up your initial, clean project structure and generates the AI Project Charter Tool.
2.  **Define Your Project:** Run `make streamlit` to launch the charter tool. This interactive application guides you through defining your project's business goals, technical requirements, architecture, and success metrics. Your answers are saved to a `project_charter.yaml` file.

### **Phase 2: Automated Scaffolding**
1.  **Generate Your Codebase:** With your charter defined, you'll run a command like `make scaffold` (to be developed).
2.  **Intelligent Code Generation:** This command reads your `project_charter.yaml` and automatically generates the specific code and infrastructure you need. For example, if you specified a RAG architecture and a PostgreSQL database, it will create the necessary Python modules, database connection files, and add the right dependencies.

### **Phase 3: Development & Implementation**
1.  **Flesh out the Skeletons:** The scaffolding gives you a complete, working project structure. Your task is to fill in the business logic inside the generated placeholder functions and classes.
2.  **Local Testing:** You can run your application locally using `make run` and run tests with `make test`.

### **Phase 4: Deployment & Operation**
1.  **Containerize:** The scaffolding process will have generated a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`. You can build your application into a container with `docker build`.
2.  **Deploy:** You can deploy this container to your cloud provider of choice.
3.  **CI/CD Automation:** The template will include a basic CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate testing and deployment on every push to your main branch.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone
- **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
- Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-forked-repo.git
  cd your-forked-repo
  ```

### 2. Run the Bootstrap Script
This script initializes your project, creating the necessary directories and the `charter_tool`.
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x validate_bootstrap.sh project_bootstrap.sh

# Validate your environment
./validate_bootstrap.sh

# Bootstrap your project
./project_bootstrap.sh
```

### 3. Launch the AI Project Charter Tool
This is the first step in defining your project.
```bash
make streamlit
```
Follow the instructions in the tool to define your project charter. Once you save it, you will be ready to move to the scaffolding phase.
