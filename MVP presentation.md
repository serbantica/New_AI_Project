# 🚀 Watsonx Orchestrate MVP Proposals – Agent Development Kit (ADK)

---

## 📌 Use Case 1: Business Project Workflow Risk Management

### 🎯 Intent
Streamline cross-functional project phases—Opportunity → Proposal → Delivery → Maintenance—via ADK-native agents, ensuring early detection and mitigation of risks.

### 👥 Users
Project Managers, PMO, Delivery Leads, Account Owners

### 🧭 Journey & ADK Implementation
1. **Tool Builder Agent** (`offer_tool`): extracts RFP info using Python/OpenAPI tool  
2. **Proposal Agent**: invokes past bid KB via RAG tool, crafts proposal  
3. **Risk Agent** (native): evaluates SLA & resource viability via external tool  
4. **Delivery Agent**: scheduled checkpoint tasks using CLI-triggered tools  
5. **Escalation Agent**: if risk threshold breached, routes to PM via Teams API tool  

Agents collaborate via `collaborators` field, orchestrated using ADK-defined YAML, imported with `orchestrate agents import`. 1

### 🤖 AI & Tech Stack
- **LLM** (e.g., granite-3‑8b‑instruct) for parsing & drafting  
- **Tools**: Python, OpenAPI/MCP connectors to Jira, Excel, Teams  
- **Memory**: RAG via KB agents built with ADK  
- **Observability**: Langfuse integrated CLI workflows 2

### 📈 Impact Metrics
- Early risk detection → 30% fewer SLA issues  
- 40% reduction in manual handovers  
- Faster delivery due to automation of repetitive checks

## 📌 Use Case 2: Supply Chain Risk Prediction & Action

### 🎯 Intent
Predict and respond to supply chain disruptions proactively via ADK agents ingesting structured + unstructured data.

### 👥 Users
Procurement Managers, Supply Ops, Logistics Analysts

### 🧭 Journey & ADK Implementation
1. **Data Ingest Tool**: Python/OpenAPI tool reads Excel + shipping APIs  
2. **Forecast Agent**: ML model (watsonx.ai via external agent) assesses delay risk  
3. **Supplier Health Agent**: monitors news via RAG tool + webhook  
4. **Decision Agent**: evaluates alternatives, orchestrates via collaborator call  
5. **Action Agent**: sends recommended steps to MS Teams via tool  

Tools & agents are orchestrated via ADK CLI with local dev and cloud deployment paths. 3

### 🤖 AI & Tech Stack
- LLM + ML for signal analysis  
- MCP / OpenAPI-connectors to ERP or shipping systems  
- Multi-agent orchestration via ADK  
- Monitoring via Langfuse + CLI stats 4

### 📈 Impact Metrics
- Up to 20% reduction in stockouts  
- <15min from risk detection to action  
- 50% fewer manual monitoring tasks

## 🧭 ADK & Orchestrate Advantages

- 🌐 **Pro‑code + CLI deployment** – builds on no-code Agent Builder  
- 🛠️ **Reusable tool definitions** – register Python/MCP/OpenAPI tools once, use across agents 5  
- 🤖 **Multi-agent workflows** – native collaborators allow complex orchestration 6  
- 🧪 **Local dev & production parity** – Developer Edition for rapid iteration, same ADK import path to prod 7  
- 📊 **Observability & governance** – Langfuse + CLI for monitoring LLM performance & compliance 8

## 📅 MVP Roadmap (6 Weeks)

| Week | Activities |
|------|------------|
| 1-2  | Define tools, agents, collaborator map; setup ADK & environment |
| 3-4  | Implement tools, RAG KBs, agents; import via CLI; test locally |
| 5    | Integrate channels (Teams/ERP); add Langfuse monitoring |
| 6    | Run pilot; measure KPIs; polish tool & agent definitions |

---

## 📌 Next Steps
- Prep ADK CLI & environments
- Produce agent/tool YAML stubs & RAG KB templates
- Validate ML models and integration pipelines
